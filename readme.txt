Completely remove Attachment Pages from your Blog

== Description ==

This Plugin allows you to remove Attachment Pages automatically generated by WordPress

= Usage =

WordPress automatically generates a page for every file you upload to your Media Library. Even if you do not want to use these Pages and never link media files to their attachment page these pages exist and can be accessed by their automated generated URL. The smart Attachment Page Remove Plugin blocks access to Attachment Pages and causes an 404 page not found error. There are not settings, just activate the Plugin.
